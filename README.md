     *****  VX RoboArena  *****



    * made by VeCTRONiX:
    - bionic       - models, textures
    - CybeREX      - models, textures, sounds
    - Krzysiek K.  - code, map, textures



    VX RoboArena is a simple game, where you can build your robot
    and fight with other robots on a simple map.


    Controls:
    * menu:
    - up/down arrows   - move
    - Enter            - change/accept
    - Esc              - back/return to game

    * game:
    - WASD            - move robot
    - mouse           - aim
    - mouse buttons   - fire
    - F1              - capture screenshot



    Some hints:
    - it's usually best to keep both mouse buttons pressed
    - enemy robots have their own reaction times, many quick attacks
      and hiding between them may be a good idea



    I hope you'll enjoy it. :)
